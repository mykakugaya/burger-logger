## Description
This burger logger application utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM to allow users to input the names of burgers they want to eat. When adding a burger, the user adds the burger to either the list of burgers to be devoured or the list of burgers that have been devoured. These burgers can be moved back and forth between the two lists by buttons changing the state of whether they have been eaten or not. The burgers can also be deleted if necessary. This restaurant application gives burger-lovers a way to keep track of the different burgers they've eaten.
